numpy intro:
- here’s an array and how to create it
- adding to an array (append)
- selecting items from the array (item)
- get the length (len)
- insert/delete items
- convenient for math (multiply an array by a scalar, add two arrays, multiply two arrays)
- check for understanding: add these two arrays, multiply each element of array by 2, get the third item in this array
array arithmetic (mean, std):
- mean/std: mean/std of ratings per decade, fill in function that calculates the mean of an array, we’ll provide the pandas code to visualize the distributions
- count_nonzero (ex. how many ratings are greater than 9?)
random.choice (sampling):
- can get chance of movie in 1980, but we can also estimate by sampling
- sample 10 movies, calculate proportion of movies that are in 1980
- fill in function that takes an array, returns proportion of decades that == 1980
- as sample size gets bigger, proportion seems more accurate
