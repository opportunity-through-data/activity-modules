# Opportunity Through Data: Activity Modules

**Opportunity Through Data**, abbreviated as *OTD*, is a UC Berkeley based organization focused on improving equity within the field of data science by offering a comprehensive introduction to individuals who would ordinarily not have access. We seek to shape the future of data science to be truly diverse and inclusive through universal access to a data science education. OTD was founded within the Big Ideas Competition at UC Berkeley in 2017. Originally starting as a three-person team, our student-run and student-led organization has now grown alongside our program. View our [website](https://otd.berkeley.edu/) to learn more about our vision. 

This repository includes all activities for each module within our eight-week, introductory data science course. Each class has a corresponding Jupyter Notebook that outlines the basic ideas learned within that class period and includes several interactive sections for students to practice what they have learned. Additionally, each activity has associated solutions that are given to teachers and (depending on the details of the course) the students.
